# Notes

## What I would like...

* Renderer (Vulkan)
* UI (DearIMGUI)
* Multithreaded job system
* General resource system
* Runtime config via text files
* Audio
* Scripting ability (Lua)
* CMake build system with drop-in project hosting setup (no idea how this works)
* Resource cooking system (python based)
* Use modern C++ features - experiment & learn
* ECS system
* Message system
* Delegates
* Experiment with retro techniques
    * Software rasterisation
* Runs fine of cheap shitty hardware
* Play about with code generation techniques... simple version of UHT ?
    * Lua interface generation ?
    * Serialisation ?
* Modular based build setup ?
* Human readable serialisation (JSON)
* Console interface

## Stuff I'd like to host with Prometheus...

* Retrotools project
* Emulators
* Ray tracing experiments
* Compute shader stuff
* General graphics research
* Electronics simulation

## How I want to bulid it

* Use CMake
	* Pretty much the standard so learn it
* Use lots of automated tests - start off with ctest
	* Get good at automated testig
	* I don't have time to test this shit manually

## Stuff I'm not going to worry about

* Platform-abstraction - focus on Linux/Vulkan
* Bleeding edge performance
* Network stuff
